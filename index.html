            <p>Nadia, I want to thank you for all your hard work with the project. I appreciate you, sharing your expertise, listening attentively to my needs and preferences and demonstrating flexibility to ensure a beautiful and functional design, which not only enhances the main bedroom, but complements the rest of my house. Your commitment, patience and customer orientation was exceptional. The workmanship of the cupboards were of a high standard and I appreciated that you, Shaun and Michelle popped in during the installation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>Hi Nadia Thank you for doing such a wonderful job. It was a pleasure to work with you: you had good ideas, a good sense of reading the client, were professional and always seemed to do what you said you would do when you said you would do it. I hope your business continues to be a success.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>My wife and I have built many homes both overseas and locally and never before have we come across such an amazing couple, Shaun and Michelle! They were simply amazing not only in their ideas but support as well. Building a home so far away from South Africa is never an easy task but having Shaun and Michelle in our corner was a Godsend and we absolutely love the finished product. We are both very proud to be associated with Core Interiors and would recommend them without hesitation to anyone who asked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>Thank you for the beautiful job you did with our kitchen installation. It really is spectacular and looks exactly how we pictured it. We look forward to working with you on future jobs for other clients.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>I have enjoyed working with you all through this project, and wish you every success in your business. Its great to be with a family owned, personal company where a client becomes a friend.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>Shaun and his team have been great to work with at every level: responsive, agreeable, on the ball, coming up with ideas and solutions to fit my requirements, and then executing efficiently and quickly, and at a very reasonable price.</p>

        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>As an architect specialising in residential renovations, I have completed several kitchen and joinery projects with Core Interiors. They have become my joiner of choice, so much so that I had them install my own kitchen recently, for which I have received many compliments. I look forward to continuing my relationship with Core Interiors and will always recommend them to my clients for quality, workmanship and personal service – a real pleasure to work with</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>We appreciated your suggestions regarding the design of our kitchen. We were impressed with your willingness in helping us decide on the colour to use on the cupboards, and then not complaining when we ended up painting them white! The project may have taken a little longer than we anticipated, but we know that you and Daniel did a thorough job. You were reliable – coming to site when you said you would. You used high quality materials and we are very happy with the end result. We would certainly use you again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>With a background in designing interiors of the highest standards internationally my requirements are rigorous and often unusual and challenging. When recently I installed extensive new joinery work in my own apartment in Cape Town this requirement remained unchanged. Core Cabinets and Interiors paid proper attention to my drawn design instruction and proved more than able to produce work that met my requirements. Core were a pleasure to work with. I would be very happy to recommend their high quality service to others.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>Many thanks for all the hard work on the cabinet, we are very pleased with how this looks and I have already highly recommended Core Interiors to a couple of people</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>Each time that I walk into our kitchen I am hugely thrilled by what you have created there. Thanks to you and your Dad for all the effort and attention to detail that you put into the design and the quality of the installation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>I have recently completed a renovation and used Core Cabinets for the manufacture and installation of a complete new kitchen and bedroom cupboards. The project was a good experience – Core were friendly, co-operative, honest, efficient, professional, cost effective and all workmanship was of the highest quality. As the project progressed there was flexibility to implement changes to improve upon the original design. We were able to have open and honest discussions to achieve an end result that was even better than originally planned and yet still within budget. I would not hesitate to recommend Core Cabinets to anyone else. In my book they stand for quality, personal service and integrity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>Wow, what amazing service! From the personal attention to understand my unique design requirements for my commissioned TV stand, to the quality of the finishes. Core Cabinets and Interiors, nailed my specification exactly and what was delivered exceeded my expectations. I can’t wait to get you to quote my kitchen next. Thank you so much to you and your team.</p>

            <p>Core Cabinets Interiors have transformed my dated 40 year old kitchen into a modern delight. Their cabinetry is superb, and their advice on best placements for kitchen furniture and appliances has meant that I can move through my kitchen with ease. I found the team working for this Company to be totally reliable. I was told the work (including building alternations) would take a month and that is just how long it took to completion. I find it important to have pleasant people working in my home, and I found all associated with Core Cabinets Interiors to be polite, patient and most helpful at all times.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-item text-centre p-4 testimonial-slide">
            <p>CORE Interiors offered us great advice with design layout when it came to redesigning our kitchen. We were very impressed with the great use of space and quality workmanship. On top of that our bedroom cupboards were to die for! The only problem is that we have subsequently moved so please can you come and work your magic at our new place!</p>
